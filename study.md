## Deliverables

After reading the `game-project` prompt and the `game-project-api` documentation
please do the following and be prepared to share and discuss during our next
class.

Submit detailed answers to these in this file via a pull request.

-   A wireframe of what your game project will look like. Desktop and mobile wireframes are located here: https://app.moqups.com/katherinetab@gmail.com/U9jeEt2UEw/view/page/a349ccaa7
-   The data structure you plan to use.
- Games and players will be stored as objects. The games will be stored as "cells" which will be an array of 9 values (the x's and o's)

-   How you will take the markup of the game board and represent it in JS
-  I plan to add event handlers and functions with jquery to the game board elements. I will associate user 1 with X and user 2 with O and create naming conventions for the functions that are associated with each users events.
-   How you plan to approach this project.
- I've created my wireframe but I would also like to model the entities to visualize the flow of the game. From there I plan to build out the initial html, then tackle the game logic. After the game logic code has been written, I will begin writing the jQuery for interactivity. I'll then start using curl to write my AJAX code and test the back-end. Once I feel I've successfully achieved the requirements I'm going to have a friend or two test the game and then I will work on the CSS and design of the game.
-   4-8 user stories for your game project.
- As a user, I want to sign up so I can keep track of my current game.
As a user, I want to play tic tac toe with another player so I can win.
As a user, I want to sign in so I can see how many games I’ve won.
As a user, I want to sign out so I can ensure no one else plays on my account.
As a user, I want to play tic tac toe because it’s easy to learn and requires strategy.
-   How you plan to keep your code modular.
- I plan to keep my code modular similar to how we created requests in class. I would like to associate events with particular functions and keep them indpendently stored in other 'files'/objects.
-   What creative spin will you add to your project. I'm going with a Taylor Swift vs. Kanye theme and hope that I'll have time to make the style changes that I'd like to go along with it. (i.e. using their faces for x's and o's and somehow incorporating Kim K into the mix as well)
-   How you will use version control to backup / track your project.
- I plan to commit early and often. I've also created a working schedule with time blocks of each portion of the project to keep myself on task. I may want to get a quick review of this from one of the consultants to ensure I'm using my time as efficiently as possible!
-   Do you plan to attempt any of the bonuses. Not at this time. My main priority is to make sure I meet all of the requirements.
